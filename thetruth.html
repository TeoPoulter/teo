        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="animate-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Many people have misconceptions that Islam is a new religion that came into existence 1,400 years ago, and that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> is the founder of the religion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In fact, Islam has existed since the beginning of time, since man set foot on this earth.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><span style="color: #3246a8;">Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> is not the founder of this religion;</span></strong><br> he is the last and final messenger of Almighty God, to whom was revealed the last and final message—the glorious Qur'an.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the other messengers that came before the last and final messenger, Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, were <strong>only sent for a particular group of people</strong>, and their message was only meant to be followed by that group for a limited time period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since all the other revelations were meant for a particular group of people and for a particular time period, the miracles performed by the earlier messengers satisfied the people of that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we cannot go back in time to examine and verify these miracles.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was not sent only for the Muslims or only for the Arabs. The glorious Qur'an says in <a href="https://quran.com/21/107" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 107</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was sent for the whole of humanity and he was the last messenger, the miracle given to him is not time-bound.
            </p>
            <p class="big-point">
                <strong>The miracle given to him should satisfy the people at that time and even today, as well as to eternity.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                It should be examinable and satisfy till eternity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: #3246a8;">It is a miracle of all times.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                It could satisfy the people of that time, it can even satisfy people today, and it can be verified and examined <em>even till the last day.</em>
            </p>

        <!-- The Origin of the Qur'an -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">The Origin of the Qur'an</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                As far as the Qur'an is concerned, any human being who has the slightest knowledge of the Qur'an, irrespective of whether he is a Muslim or non-Muslim, can have various allegations or replies—right or wrong—about its origin.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of them can be broadly classified into three categories:
            </p>
            <ol style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li style="color: var(--error-color); font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    That Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was consciously, subconsciously, or unconsciously the author of the Qur'an.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li style="color: var(--error-color); font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    That the Qur'an was written by Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> who learned it from other sources or he copied or plagiarized from other religious scriptures.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li style="color: var(--accent-color); font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    That the Qur'an has no human origin, no human source, and it is word by word the revelation from Almighty God.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="big-point">
                <strong>Any answers you have for the origin of the Qur'an can be broadly classified into these three categories.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, let's examine and verify the various answers given by different human beings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Could Prophet Muhammad ﷺ Be the Author? -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">Could Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> Be the Author?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                First, we will discuss: Can Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> be the author of the Qur'an, whether consciously, subconsciously, or unconsciously?
            </p>
            <p>
                It is unfortunate when an individual disputes another person's modest claim of not being responsible for a significant work, whether in literature or science.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is exactly what the critics of Islam do when they say that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was the author of the Qur'an.
            </p>

                Never has the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> ever claimed that he was the author of the Qur'an, <strong>not even a single word of it</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, when he disclaimed that he was not the author, and the Qur'an happens to be a masterpiece of Arabic literature, why would a person disclaim the responsibility of a work which is a masterpiece?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why should he lie?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                From his youth till the day he claimed prophethood at the age of forty, never has a single lie been reported to have been said by Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was known for his truthfulness, honesty, and chastity, and he was given the title "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) by friends and foes alike.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even after he claimed prophethood, his enemies kept their valuables with him for safekeeping.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> migrated from Mecca to Medina, we have the example of Abu Sufyan, who was the chief of one of the tribes of Mecca.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he went to Emperor Heraclius and asked him for support against the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, the Emperor asked him, <em>"Do you know of any instance where the Prophet lied or committed any injustice?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Abu Sufyan, even though he was an enemy of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> at that time, had to reply, "No."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>So why should a person with such honesty, trust, and chastity lie?</strong>

        <!-- Allegations Against the Prophet ﷺ -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">Allegations Against the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Let's analyze the various claims made by critics of Islam against Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Material Gains</h3>
            <p>
                One of the claims made by the critics of Islam is that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> lied that he was not the author of the Qur'an and said it was from Almighty God for material gains.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that there are many men who claim to be prophets, preachers, or saints in order to lead a luxurious life, and we have hundreds and thousands of examples in the world today.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if we see the lifestyle of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, he led a more luxurious life before he claimed prophethood than after.
            </p>
            <p>
                If he did it for money, his life should have been better after claiming prophethood, like we see today with those who claim to be prophets and saints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we have records in several Sahih Hadith, including the Hadith narrated by <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2567" target="_blank">Urwa ibn al-Zubayr, Sahih al-Bukhari 2567</a>, that one of his wives, Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her), said that there were times when fire was not lit in the house for a month or two, indicating that food was not cooked for a month or two, and they only survived on dates and water, and sometimes milk given by the neighbors.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Desire for Fame and Leadership</h3>
            <p>
                Some critics say that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to Almighty God because he wanted fame, status, glory, and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Michael H. Hart, who wrote <em>"The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History,"</em> he analyzes all the human beings from Adam (peace be upon him) till the present time and undeniably puts Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> as number one as being the most influential person in the history of humankind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, if he wanted glory, fame, power, or leadership, he was so eloquent; he had all the qualities; he did not have to falsely attribute the Qur'an to Almighty God.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we analyze logically, any person who wants power, glory, leadership, fame, status, along with it is attached good food, fancy clothes, magnificent, monumental palaces, guards, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if we see the lifestyle of Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, he mended his own clothes; he repaired his own shoes; he milked the goat and did his own household work.
            </p>
            <p>
                He sat on the floor and ate.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he went to the marketplace, he didn't have any colorful guards.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was an example of simplicity and humbleness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who invited him, even the poor, he would accept their invitation and eat whatever was served to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                So much so that his enemies passed remarks, which are mentioned in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/9/61" target="_blank">Surah At-Tawbah, Chapter 9, Verse 61</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ ۚ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, 'He is an ear.'" [i.e., he listens to everyone]</em>
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Unifying the Arabs</h3>
            <p>
                Some critics say that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to Almighty God because he wanted to unite the Arabs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is known as the <em>Arab Unity and Liberation Theory.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is not a single verse in the Qur'an which singles out and speaks exclusively of Arab unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Qur'an has the concept of "Ummah," which is the nation of the whole of humankind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The criteria for any human being to be superior to any other human being is not caste, color, wealth, or sex, but it is piety and righteousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is mentioned in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/49/13" target="_blank">Surah Al-Hujurat, Chapter 49, Verse 13</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ
                وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ
                إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ ۚ
                إِنَّ اللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.
                Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.
                Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> wanted unity among the Arabs, he could have easily taken the leadership and become the leader and the king and united the Arabs easily.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Moral Reformation</h3>
            <p>
                Another allegation is known as the <em>Theory for Moral Reformation.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Critics say the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to Almighty God because he wanted to reform the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why should a person lie to reform the people morally?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to be truthful, you cannot lie to be truthful.
            </p>
            <p>
                The means should match with the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the Qur'an says in <a href="https://quran.com/6/93" target="_blank">Surah Al-An'am, Chapter 6, Verse 93</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah..."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                There were chances that one day later on the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> would have been exposed, and he would be cursing himself in the same book.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Was the Qur'an Plagiarized? -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">Was the Qur'an Plagiarized?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Let's discuss the second category: that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learned it from other sources or he copied or plagiarized from other religious scriptures.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are various allegations made by non-Muslims and the critics of Islam that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learned the Qur'an from a Roman blacksmith who was living on the outskirts of Mecca.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah responds to this allegation in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/16/103" target="_blank">Surah An-Nahl, Chapter 16, Verse 103</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ
                إِنَّمَا يُعَلِّمُهُ بَشَرٌ ۗ
                لِسَانُ الَّذِي يُلْحِدُونَ إِلَيْهِ
                أَعْجَمِيٌّ وَهَٰذَا
                لِسَانٌ عَرَبِيٌّ مُّبِينٌ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And We certainly know that they say, 'It is only a human being who teaches him.'
                The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this [Qur'an] is [in] a clear Arabic language."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Roman blacksmith could hardly speak Arabic; he was a foreigner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How could the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learn from him?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people say that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learned from Waraqah ibn Nawfal, the relative of his wife Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her).
            </p>
            <p>
                But historical records show that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> met Waraqah only twice in his life: once before he claimed prophethood, and the second time immediately after the first revelation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Waraqah died three years later, and the Qur'an continued to be revealed for 22 years after that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some say he learned from the Jews and Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> had limited interactions with them, and it was the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> who was teaching them about the true message of God, not the other way around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we know that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was illiterate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/29/48" target="_blank">Surah Al-Ankabut, Chapter 29, Verse 48</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُو مِن قَبْلِهِ

                إِذًا لَّارْتَابَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand.
                Otherwise the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This verse points out that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was unlettered and could not read or write.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the question of copying from previous scriptures does not arise.

            <p>
                The Qur'an contains numerous scientific facts that were unknown at the time of its revelation and have only been discovered recently.

            <h3 class="animate-title">The Big Bang</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions the Big Bang in <a href="https://quran.com/21/30" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 30</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">

            </p>
            <p>
                This verse accurately describes the Big Bang theory, which scientists discovered only about 50 years ago.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Shape of the Earth</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an describes the Earth's shape in <a href="https://quran.com/79/30" target="_blank">Surah An-Nazi'at, Chapter 79, Verse 30</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">

                <em>"And after that He spread the earth."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The word "dahaha" means to make the earth egg-shaped, specifically like the ostrich egg, which is geospherical in shape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern science has confirmed that the Earth is not completely round like a ball but is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Light of the Moon</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions that the light of the moon is reflected light in <a href="https://quran.com/25/61" target="_blank">Surah Al-Furqan, Chapter 25, Verse 61</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ

            <p>
                <em>"Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Arabic words used distinguish between the sun (Siraj) as a lamp emitting its own light and the moon (Qamar) as Munir, which means borrowed or reflected light.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Sun's Rotation</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions the sun's rotation in <a href="https://quran.com/21/33" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 33</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ

            </p>
            <p>
                Modern science tells us that the sun rotates on its axis, taking approximately 25 days to complete one rotation.

            <p>

                <em>"Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs in the earth; then He produces thereby crops of varying colors..."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The water cycle was first described by Bernard Palissy in 1580, but the Qur'an mentioned it 1,400 years ago.

            <h3 class="animate-title">Mountains as Pegs</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an describes mountains as pegs in <a href="https://quran.com/78/6-7" target="_blank">Surah An-Naba, Chapter 78, Verses 6-7</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ الْأَرْضَ مِهَادًا
                وَالْجِبَالَ أَوْتَادًا
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern geology has confirmed that mountains have deep roots and act like stakes or pegs stabilizing the Earth's crust.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Barrier Between Seas</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions the barrier between seas in <a href="https://quran.com/25/53" target="_blank">Surah Al-Furqan, Chapter 25, Verse 53</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَهُوَ الَّذِي مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ
                هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ
                وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ
                وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا
                وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern science has discovered that in places where two different seas meet, there is a barrier between them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Creation from Water</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an states that all living things are made of water in <a href="https://quran.com/21/30" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 30</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ ۖ
                أَفَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"...and We made from water every living thing. Then will they not believe?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Science has confirmed that all living organisms consist mostly of water.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Fingerprints</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions in <a href="https://quran.com/75/3-4" target="_blank">Surah Al-Qiyamah, Chapter 75, Verses 3-4</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ

            <p>
                <em>"Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                It was in 1880 that Sir Francis Galton discovered the fingerprinting method.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentioned this fact 1,400 years ago.

            <h3 class="animate-title">Pain Receptors</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions in <a href="https://quran.com/4/56" target="_blank">Surah An-Nisa, Chapter 4, Verse 56</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا
                سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا
                كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ
                بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا
                لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses—We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment..."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern science has discovered that pain receptors are present in the skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                This knowledge was only discovered recently, yet the Qur'an mentioned it 1,400 years ago.

                The Qur'an contains numerous such scientific facts and miracles that were impossible for any human being to know 1,400 years ago.
