    <h3>What is Islam?</h3>
    <p>
        Many people have misconceptions that Islam is a new religion that came into existence 1,400 years ago, and that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> is the founder of the religion.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>In fact, Islam has existed since the beginning of time.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span></h3>
    <p>
        In Islam, like Christianity and Judaism, we believe in Prophets - essentially, the best of people chosen by God to deliver a message or guide society in the right direction.
    </p>
<p>
    We believe in many of the same Prophets as these Abrahamic faiths, IE:
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">Jesus (Isa)</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">Moses (Musa)</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">Abraham (Ibrahim)</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">Joseph (Yusuf)</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">Noah (Nooh)</p>
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.2;">And so on.</p>
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;" />
<p style="margin: 0;">What differentiates Islam from these other faiths is our belief in one final Prophet - Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>



    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: #3498db;">Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> is not the founder of this religion;</span></strong> he is the last and final messenger of God, to whom was revealed the last and final message—the glorious Qur'an.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the other messengers that came before the last and final messenger, Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, were <strong>only sent for a particular group of people</strong>, and their message was only meant to be followed by that group for a limited time period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since all the other revelations were meant for a particular group of people and for a particular time period, the miracles performed by the earlier messengers satisfied the people of that time.
    </p>

   
    
    <h3>The Universality of Islam</h3>
    <p>
        But Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was not sent only for the Muslims or only for the Arabs. The glorious Qur'an says in <a href="https://quran.com/21/107" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 107</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was sent for the whole of humanity and he was the last messenger, the miracle given to him, The Qur'an, is not time-bound.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Qur'an: The Eternal Miracle</h3>
    <p class="big-point">
        <strong>The miracle given to him should satisfy the people of that time and at any point in time.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be examinable and satisfy till eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: #3498db;">It is a miracle of all times.</span>
    </p>

    
    <h3>Islam's Emphasis on Evidence</h3>
    <p>
        Islam is unique because it doesn't just claim to be the truth; it provides evidence and proofs that can be examined and verified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/2/111" target="_blank">Surah Al-Baqarah, Chapter 2, Verse 111</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Islam encourages seeking evidence and using reason to arrive at the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page strives to present such evidence in a logical and truthful way.

<!-- Could Prophet Muhammad ﷺ Be the Author? -->
<button class="collapsible animate-title">Could Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> Be the Author?</button>
<div class="content section">
    <h3>Authorship of the Qur'an</h3>
    <p>
        Can Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> be the author of the Qur'an?
    </p>
    <p>
        It is unfortunate when an individual disputes another person's modest claim of not being responsible for a significant work.    </p>
    <p>
        But this is exactly what the critics of Islam do when they say that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was the author of the Qur'an.
    </p>

    <h3>The Prophet's <span>&#xFDFA;</span> Denial</h3>
    <p>
        Never did the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> ever claim that he was the author of the Qur'an, <strong>not even a single word of it</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, when he disclaimed that he was not the author, and the Qur'an happens to be a masterpiece of Arabic literature, why would a person disclaim the responsibility of a work which is a masterpiece?
    </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why should he lie?</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>The Prophet's <span>&#xFDFA;</span> Character</h3>
    <p>
        From his youth till the day he claimed prophethood at the age of forty, never has a single lie been reported to have been said by Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> - even his enemies admitted this.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was known for his truthfulness, honesty, and chastity, and he was given the title "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) by friends and foes alike.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even after he claimed prophethood, leaders from enemy communities (tribes) kept their valuables with him for safekeeping.
    </p>

    <h3>The Testimony of Abu Sufyan</h3>
    <p>
        When the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> migrated from Mecca to Medina, we have the example of Abu Sufyan, who was the chief of one of the tribes of Mecca.
    </p>
    <p>
        When he went to Emperor Heraclius and asked him for support against the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, the Emperor asked him, <em>"Do you know of any instance where the Prophet lied or committed any injustice?"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Abu Sufyan, even though he was an enemy of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> at that time, had to reply, "No."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>So why should a person with such honesty and trust lie?</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Refuting Claims of Delusion</h3>
    <p>
        Some critics say that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was deluded or possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        But a deluded person cannot produce a work of such magnitude and perfection as the Qur'an.
    </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>
    <p>
        Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/68/2" target="_blank">Surah Al-Qalam, Chapter 68, Verse 2</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        مَا أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"You are not, [O Muhammad], by the favor of your Lord, a madman."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The life of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> is also a testimony to his excellent mind, wisdom, and character.
    </p>

        <!-- Allegations Against the Prophet ﷺ -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">Allegations Against the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span></button>
        <div class="content section">


            <h3 class="animate-title">Material Gains</h3>
            <p>
                One of the claims made by the critics of Islam is that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> lied that he was not the author of the Qur'an and said it was from God for material gains.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that there are many men who claim to be prophets, preachers, or saints in order to lead a luxurious life, and we have hundreds and thousands of examples in the world today.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if we see the lifestyle of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, he led a more luxurious life before he claimed prophethood than after.
            </p>
            <p>
                If he did it for money, his life should have been better after claiming prophethood, like we see today with those who claim to be prophets and saints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we have records in several Authentic Hadith (narrations about the Prophet and his life), including the Hadith narrated by <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2567" target="_blank">Urwa ibn al-Zubayr, Sahih al-Bukhari 2567</a>, that his wife Aisha (may God be pleased with her), said that there were times when fire was not lit in the house for a month or two, indicating that food was not cooked for this time, and that they only survived on dates and water, and sometimes milk given by the neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Desire: Fame and Leadership</h3>
            <p>
                Some critics say that Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to God because he wanted fame, status, glory, and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, wanted glory, fame, power, or leadership, since he was so eloquent; he had all the qualities; then he did not have to falsely attribute the Qur'an to Almighty God.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we analyze logically, any person who wants power, glory, leadership, fame, status, along with it is attached good food, fancy clothes, magnificent, monumental palaces, guards, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if we see the lifestyle of Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span>, he mended his own clothes; he repaired his own shoes; he milked the goat and did his own household work.
            </p>
            <p>
                He sat on the floor and ate.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he went to the marketplace, he didn't have any colorful guards.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was an example of simplicity and humbleness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who invited him, even the poor, he would accept their invitation and eat whatever was served to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                So much so that his enemies passed remarks, which are mentioned in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/9/61" target="_blank">Surah At-Tawbah, Chapter 9, Verse 61</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ ۚ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, 'He is an ear.'" [i.e., he listens to everyone]</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Unifying the Arabs</h3>
            <p>
                Some critics say that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to Almighty God because he wanted to unite the Arabs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is known as the <em>Arab Unity and Liberation Theory.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is not a single verse in the Qur'an which singles out and speaks exclusively of Arab unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Qur'an has the concept of "Ummah," which is the nation of the whole of humankind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The criteria for any human being to be superior to any other human being is not caste, color, wealth, or sex, but it is piety and righteousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is mentioned in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/49/13" target="_blank">Surah Al-Hujurat, Chapter 49, Verse 13</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ
                وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ
                إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ ۚ
                إِنَّ اللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.
                Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.
                Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> wanted unity among the Arabs, he could have easily taken the leadership and become the leader and the king and united the Arabs easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">Moral Reformation</h3>
            <p>
                Another allegation is known as the <em>Theory for Moral Reformation.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Critics say the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> attributed the Qur'an to Almighty God because he wanted to reform the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why should a person lie to reform the people morally?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to be truthful, you cannot lie to be truthful.
            </p>
            <p>
                The means should match with the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the Qur'an says in <a href="https://quran.com/6/93" target="_blank">Surah Al-An'am, Chapter 6, Verse 93</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah..."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                There were chances that one day later on the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> would have been exposed, and he would be cursing himself in the same book.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>















        <!-- Was the Qur'an Plagiarized? -->
        <button class="collapsible animate-title">Was the Qur'an Plagiarized?</button>
        <div class="content section">
            <p>
                There are various allegations made by non-Muslims and the critics of Islam that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learned the Qur'an from a Roman blacksmith who was living on the outskirts of Mecca.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah responds to this allegation in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/16/103" target="_blank">Surah An-Nahl, Chapter 16, Verse 103</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">

            <p>
                <em>"And We certainly know that they say, 'It is only a human being who teaches him.'
                The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this [Qur'an] is [in] a clear Arabic language."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Roman blacksmith could hardly speak Arabic; he was a foreigner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How could the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learn from him?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people say that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> learned from Waraqah ibn Nawfal, the relative of his wife Khadijah (may God be pleased with her).
            </p>
            <p>
                But historical records show that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> met Waraqah only twice in his life: once before he claimed prophethood, and the second time immediately after the first revelation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Waraqah died three years later, and the Qur'an continued to be revealed for 22 years after that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some say he learned from the Jews and Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> had limited interactions with them, and it was the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> who was teaching them about the true message of God, not the other way around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we know that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was illiterate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/29/48" target="_blank">Surah Al-Ankabut, Chapter 29, Verse 48</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُو مِن قَبْلِهِ

                إِذًا لَّارْتَابَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ

            <p>
                <em>"You ˹O Prophet˺ could not read any writing ˹even˺ before this ˹revelation˺, nor could you write at all. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have been suspicious."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This verse points out that the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> was unlettered and could not read or write.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the question of copying from previous scriptures does not arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, this claim falls apart.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, if the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> had copied from the Bible or other scriptures, why did he correct them on matters where they had erred?
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the Bible mentions that the Pharaoh at the time of Joseph was called "Pharaoh," but the Qur'an correctly refers to him as "King," since the term "Pharaoh" was not used during Joseph's time.
            </p>
            <p>
                How could an unlettered man in the desert know such historical details that were only discovered recently?

                When the Qur'an was revealed, it challenged them in their own field of expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/17/88" target="_blank">Surah Al-Isra, Chapter 17, Verse 88</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الْإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ
                عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُوا بِمِثْلِ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ
                لَا يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ
                وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.”" </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Qur'an has a unique style that is neither poetry nor prose.
            </p>
            <p>
                It introduced new linguistic structures, new words, and used existing words in ways that were unprecedented.
            </p>
            <p>
                The eloquence and depth of the Qur'an amazed the Arabs, and many of them accepted Islam just by hearing its verses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the enemies of Islam accused the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span> of being a magician because they could not explain the powerful effect the Qur'an had on people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their expertise, they could not produce even a single chapter like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allah reduced the challenge in stages, first asking them to produce a Qur'an like it, then ten chapters, then even a single chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <a href="https://quran.com/2/23" target="_blank">Surah Al-Baqarah, Chapter 2, Verse 23</a>, Allah says:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">
                وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا
                عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ
                وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُم مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ
                إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ
            </div>
            <p>
                <em>"And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant,1 then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                To this day, no one has been able to meet this challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thus, the claim that the Qur'an could've been written by a human, especially an illiterate one, falls apart.</strong>

                The Qur'an is the only religious scripture that has been preserved in its exact original form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not a single word or letter has ever changed over 1400 years - with many evidences for this, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Quran_manuscript" target="_blank">Birmingham Manuscript</a> recently.

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The Qur'an has been transmitted through both oral and written means without any alteration.

    <h3>Unknown Historical Facts Revealed</h3>
    <p>
        The Qur'an contains historical information that was unknown at the time and has been confirmed by modern discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the Qur'an mentions in <a href="https://quran.com/44/29" target="_blank">Surah Ad-Dukhan, Chapter 44, Verse 29</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        فَمَا بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّمَاءُ وَالْأَرْضُ
        وَمَا كَانُوا مُنظَرِينَ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"And the heaven and earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved."</em>
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Beliefs of Ancient Egyptians</h3>
    <p>
        It was discovered that the ancient Egyptians believed that the sky and earth wept when a great person died.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Qur'an refutes this belief, stating that the sky and earth did not weep for Pharaoh and his people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such details were unknown at the time of the Prophet <span>&#xFDFA;</span>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Accurate Titles for Egyptian Rulers</h3>
    <p>
        Another example is the distinction the Qur'an makes between the titles used for the ruler of Egypt during the time of Joseph and Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the story of Joseph, the ruler is referred to as "King," while in Moses's story, he is called "Pharaoh."
    </p>
    <p>
        Historical records confirm that the title "Pharaoh" was not used until the New Kingdom period in Egypt, which was after Joseph's time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How could a human know this?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Bible, however, uses "Pharaoh" in both stories, which is historically inaccurate.
    </p>
    
    <h3>A Question of Knowledge</h3>
    <p>
        How could anyone but God have known such precise historical details?

    <h3>Foretelling Future Events</h3>
    <p>
        Allah tells us in the Qur'an that He reveals certain parts of the unseen (future) to Messengers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, The Prophet Muhammad <span>&#xFDFA;</span> made numerous prophecies about future events, many of which have come to pass. The Qur'an also does this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a selection of some of these prophecies:
    </p>

    <!-- 1. The Byzantines Will Rebound -->
    <h3>The Byzantines Will Rebound</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Qur'anic Prophecy:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        During a time when the Byzantine Empire was on the verge of collapse, the Qur'an foretold their victory over the Persians within a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/30/2-4" target="_blank">Surah Ar-Rum, Chapter 30, Verses 2-4</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ<br>
        فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ<br>
        فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ ۗ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"The Byzantines have been defeated in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome within three to nine years."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This prophecy came true when the Byzantines defeated the Persians several years later.
    </p>


    <!-- 2. The Fate of Abu Lahab -->
    <h3>The Fate of Abu Lahab</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Qur'anic Prophecy:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Qur'an predicted that Abu Lahab, an uncle of the Prophet who opposed him, would die a disbeliever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Allah says in the Qur'an in <a href="https://quran.com/111" target="_blank">Surah Al-Masad, Chapter 111, Verses 1-3</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="arabic">
        تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ<br>
        مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ<br>
        سَيَصْلَىٰ نَارًا ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>"May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained. He will burn in a Fire of blazing flame."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite hearing this, Abu Lahab never embraced Islam and died as a disbeliever, fulfilling the prophecy.

                The Qur'an contains numerous scientific facts that were unknown at the time of its revelation and have only been discovered recently.
            </p>

            <h3 class="animate-title">The Big Bang</h3>
            <p>
                The Qur'an mentions the Big Bang in <a href="https://quran.com/21/30" target="_blank">Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter 21, Verse 30</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="arabic">

                In <a href="https://quran.com/23/12-14" target="_blank">Surah Al-Mu'minun, Chapter 23, Verses 12-14</a>, Allah says:

            <h3 class="animate-title">Mountains as Pegs</h3>
            <p>
